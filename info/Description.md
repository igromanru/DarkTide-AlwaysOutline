Always Outline
==============
### Descriptions
The mod applies outlines to all or chosen enemy groups automatically.

If you don't know how the game works, I recommend playing it without the mod first, otherwise you should know that the outlines are visible through the walls and basically act as a wallhack.


### Settings
Per default the mod uses the color [Grey](https://www.colorhexa.com/808080) (128, 128, 128) for all outlines. If you want to improve the visibility, you can simply change it to [White](https://www.colorhexa.com/ffffff) (255, 255, 255).  

Per default only Specialist, Elite and Monstrosity are enabled.  
  

### Installation via Vortex
I assume that you know how Vortex works and that you have set it up to work with Darktide.  
Make sure that you've installed the [Darktide Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/19) and the [Darktide Mod Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/8) first.  
1.  Navigate into the **Mods** tab.
2.  If the "Drop file" panel is hidden, open it with the arrow down button at the bottom right corner.
3.  Drag and drop mod's zip file into the "Drop File(s)" field.
4.  The mod should be installed now, verity that it's enabled.
